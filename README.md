Hello, my name is Emma Zimmerman- or Emma Zim as I'm calling myself here. I mostly work in Python and JS but I'm happy to try anything else (except Java).
I have a special interest in projects that involve AI/ML but I'm also ready for a challenge. 

You can reach me at emmazimmerman98@gmail.com if you want to talk!
